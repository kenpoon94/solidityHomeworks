6. The back-end is implemented using Nestjs

Front End UI: Please see the summary report PDF


Front end features:
1. Create a new [Random] Wallet workflow
2. Sign in with the new wallet to interact with Token and Ballot smart contracts

4. Display the account, Token and Ballot smart contract addresses
5. Read account balance, token balance and voting power from the blockchain
6. Request Token feature to mint and update the blockchain
7. Ballot proposals feature to display the proposals

Summary of my homework:
Developed the front end and back end functionality for the Tokenized Ballot dApp
Back end token functionality was initially cloned from Raj
Collaborated with my team on the homework
Worked with Adrian on git functionality
Tested the functionality on Goerli Testnet
Committed working software to Github

Front End UI:





Front end features:
Enter a wallet address to see values from the blockchain for the deployed contracts
Started functionality to connect to MetaMask but was unable to finish
Able to interact with Token contract to get information for the entered wallet
Display the wallet address, Token contract address, and Ballot contract address
Read account balance, token balance, voting power, and Ballot winner from the blockchain
Request Token feature to mint tokens to the provided wallet and update the blockchain
Voting feature to cast vote on a proposal
This is currently voting from the wallet in my .env file. When connection to MetaMask is established it will vote from connected wallet
Tally votes and display winner


Front End Updates I would like to make
Get MetMask connection working
Update vote to use MetaMask connection
Have it update automatically after minting or voting
Make it prettier
Get proposal details from blockchain, these are currently hard coded
Display more information while transaction is in progress

Back end features and Swagger Hub testing:


Backend Features:
Token-address, request-tokens, self-delegate, voting-power, and token-balance were available in the initial clone from Raj
Added vote and the voteInfo schema for casting votes to the Ballot contract
