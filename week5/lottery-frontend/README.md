## Too much fighting with Angular 15 and had to reinstall front end from scratch with Angular 14

Here is my cheatsheet for the front-end (lesson 15)
ng new lottery-frontend
Yes to Angular routing
Select SCSS for stylesheet
cd ./lottery-frontend
ng serve (to test the setup)
exit (ctrl-c)
npm install ethers or yarn add ethers
yarn add bootstrap bootstrap-icons
yarn add @popperjs/core
yarn add @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap
In angular.json be sure to have these lines -
            "styles": [
              "node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss",
              "node_modules/bootstrap-icons/font/bootstrap-icons.css",
              "src/styles.scss"
            ],
            "scripts": [
              "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
            ]
...
In app.module.ts be sure to include NgbModule like this -
import { NgbModule } from '@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap';
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    NgbModule
  ],
...
Make sure the following lines are added to tsconfig.json
  "compilerOptions": {
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    ...
